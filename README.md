# üõí Retail Sales Data Analysis

## ‚ú® Overview  
This project analyzes retail sales data to uncover trends, high-performing products, and sales patterns across time and geography. Using **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)**, we cleaned, transformed, and visualized the data, providing actionable insights for retail strategy optimization.

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset used for the analysis includes the following columns:

InvoiceNo: Unique identifier for each transaction.
StockCode: Identifier for the product.
Description: Description of the product.
Quantity: Number of units purchased.
InvoiceDate: Date and time of the transaction.
UnitPrice: Price per unit of the product.
CustomerID: Unique identifier for the customer.
Country: Country where the transaction occurred.

## üìä Key Highlights

- **Top Products**: Identified the top 10 products by sales revenue.
- **Sales Trends**: Highlighted monthly and seasonal sales trends using time-series analysis.
- **Geographical Insights**: Displayed the top 10 countries contributing to total sales.
- **Yearly Patterns**: Analyzed yearly sales trends to track business growth over time.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Cleaning & Preparation

- Data Loading: The CSV file is read into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Handled missing data by filling or dropping as needed:
  - `CustomerID`: Rows with missing values dropped.
  - `Description`: Replaced missing values with "Unknown."
- Removed duplicate rows to ensure accuracy.
- Created new calculated fields like **`Sales`** (`Quantity √ó UnitPrice`) for deeper analysis.
